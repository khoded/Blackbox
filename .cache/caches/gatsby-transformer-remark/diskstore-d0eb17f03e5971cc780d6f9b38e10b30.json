We had got some really cool projects even though they were small, built with lttle knowledge of programming. Attendees were able to make use of technologies like Actions on Google, Thunkable and BuildBox to build something small for prototyping their impactful ideas. We had 3 different themes for the hackathon.","position":{"start":{"line":37,"column":409,"offset":6050},"end":{"line":37,"column":1039,"offset":6680}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":37,"column":1,"offset":5642},"end":{"line":37,"column":1039,"offset":6680}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"ol","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Entertainment","position":{"start":{"line":39,"column":4,"offset":6685},"end":{"line":39,"column":17,"offset":6698}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":39,"column":4,"offset":6685},"end":{"line":39,"column":17,"offset":6698}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}],"position":{"start":{"line":39,"column":1,"offset":6682},"end":{"line":40,"column":1,"offset":6699}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Education","position":{"start":{"line":41,"column":4,"offset":6703},"end":{"line":41,"column":13,"offset":6712}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":41,"column":4,"offset":6703},"end":{"line":41,"column":13,"offset":6712}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}],"position":{"start":{"line":41,"column":1,"offset":6700},"end":{"line":42,"column":1,"offset":6713}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Productivity","position":{"start":{"line":43,"column":4,"offset":6717},"end":{"line":43,"column":16,"offset":6729}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":43,"column":4,"offset":6717},"end":{"line":43,"column":16,"offset":6729}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}],"position":{"start":{"line":43,"column":1,"offset":6714},"end":{"line":43,"column":16,"offset":6729}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}],"position":{"start":{"line":39,"column":1,"offset":6682},"end":{"line":43,"column":16,"offset":6729}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Themes were chosen based on the ease of finding ideas to build on it and we had to choose the best hack from each theme to award them with prizes.
